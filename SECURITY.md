## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of this project seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not** open a public issue.

Instead, please:

1.  Report it via the "Security" tab in the GitHub repository (Private Vulnerability Reporting), if enabled.
2.  Or contact the maintainers directly through their GitHub profile contact information.

We will make every effort to acknowledge your report and address the issue promptly. We appreciate your responsible disclosure.
